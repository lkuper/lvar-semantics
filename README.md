lambdaLVar-redex
================

A PLT Redex model of a variant of the lambdaLVar language.

### lambdaLVar in a nutshell

lambdaLVar is a deterministic parallel calculus with shared state.  It
is an untyped lambda calculus extended with a store and with `put` and
`get` operations that write to and read from shared variables.  In
this setting of shared mutable state, the trick that lambdaLVar
employs to maintain determinism is that writes must be _monotonically
increasing_ with respect to a user-specified partial order, and reads
must make only limited observations of the states of variables -- for
instance, in a lambdaLVar program it might be possible to observe that
a store location containes "at least 4", but not possible to observe
the precise value.

Section 3 of the technical report ["A Lattice-Theoretical Approach to
Deterministic Parallelism with Shared State"][lambdaLVar-TR] presents
the syntax and semantics of lambdaLVar.  The code in this directory is
a PLT Redex model of the semantics given in the TR.

### Modeling lattice parameterization in Redex

lambdaLVar's store contains "lattice variables", or LVars. An LVar is
a variable whose value can only increase over time, where the meaning
of "increase" is given by a partially ordered set, or _lattice_, that
the user of the language specifies. Therefore lambdaLVar is really a
family of languages.  Different instantiations of the lattice result
in different languages, all of which are parallel and deterministic.

In the Redex of today, it's not possible to parameterize a language
definition by a lattice (see discussion
[here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15800167/plt-redex-parameterizing-a-language-definition),
for instance), so instead, we define a Racket macro,
`define-lambdaLVar-language`, that takes a language name, a least
upper bound operation, and a set of lattice values, and generates a
Redex language definition.  For instance, to generate a Redex language
model called `lambdaLVar-nat` where the user-specified lattice is the
natural numbers with `max` as the least upper bound, one can write:

```
(define-lambdaLVar-language lambdaLVar-nat max natural)
```

The `nat` directory contains a test suite of programs for
`lambdaLVar-nat`.  `natpair` and `natpair-ivars` are two more example
instantiations.

### Modeling truly simultaneous reductions in Redex

With Redex, one typically defines a [Felleisen-and-Hieb-style
reduction semantics based on _evaluation contexts_][eval-contexts]. An
evaluation-context-based semantics is what Redex is best at
expressing, and such a semantics would eliminate the need to
explicitly specify "structural" rules like E-Put-1 and E-Put-2 in our
semantics.  Instead, we could simply specify a set of evaluation
contexts:

```
(E hole (put E e) (put e E) ...)
```

Unfortunately, such _single-hole_ evaluation contexts force evaluation
to be sequential, and we want to model the explicit simultaneous
evaluation steps of the E-ParApp rule of our semantics.  (To be sure, a
semantics specified with single-hole evaluation contexts can express
_arbitrary_ evaluation order and therefore remains open to the
possibility of parallel _implementation_. Still, since parallelism is
lambdaLVar's _raison d'Ãªtre_, we want to bake parallelism into the
model.)

Since Redex [does not have support for multiple-hole evaluation
contexts][racket-list-message], we opted instead for an
inference-rule-based semantics implemented using Redex's
[`define-judgment-form`][define-judgment-form] feature.
Unfortunately, in so doing, we miss out on some of Redex's most useful
features.  ~~As a tiny example of what we're missing,
`define-judgment-form` offers no way to name individual reduction
rules, so although using Redex's [`traces`][traces] feature with our
semantics will show us a beautiful reduction graph of a configuration,
it won't label the edges in the graphs with the names of the reduction
rules as it would normally, because Redex has no way of knowing their
names.~~ Actually, this is no longer true -- the ability to name
clauses in `define-judgment-form` was added in Racket release 5.3.1.
But it's still going to take additional effort to get the names of
rules to appear in the visualization.

The Redex model is useful despite these limitations.  However, it
would be interesting to try modeling lambdaLVar in a framework that has
better support for truly simultaneous reductions -- the [K
system][k-framework] comes to mind.

### Dealing with reflexive relations

The reflexive reduction rules E-Refl and E-ReflErr of our paper
semantics pose a dilemma for the Redex testing infrastructure. Redex's
built-in `test-->>` mechanism for testing a reduction relation finds
all irreducible terms reachable from a given term, but with E-Refl and
E-ReflErr present in the reduction relation, no lambdaLVar terms would
be irreducible under it, so it wouldn't be possible to write tests
with `test-->>`.  An alternative testing mechanism, `test-->>E`,
checks if there _exists_ a reduction path from one given term to
another, but since the property we are most interested in testing for
is determinism, that mechanism is also unsatisfactory since we wish to
know not only that one term reduces to another, but that _all_
possible reductions take us from the first to the second.

Fortunately, there is a simple workaround: we drop the E-Refl and
 E-ReflErr rules from our semantics and instead add two new rules,
 E-App-1 and E-App-2, by which parallel application expressions may
 take a step even if only one of their subexpressions can take a step.
 The result is a semantics that is feasible to test with Redex.
This reduction relation is called `slow-rr`.

### Speed tweaks

Under the semantics just described, if both subexpressions in an
application can step, then any of three rules can apply next --
E-App-1, E-App-2, and E-ParApp -- leading to an exponential increase
in the number of evaluation paths that an configuration might take. It
is easy to construct lambdaLVar programs that are very slow to test
with `test-->>` under this semantics, because the system must take all
evaluation paths.  Of course, taking all evaluation paths is exactly
the behavior we want.  Although we can't prove determinism with Redex,
we _can_ prove the _absence_ of determinism -- a reduction graph that
does not converge means that there's a nondeterminism-introducing bug
somewhere.  Nevertheless, sometimes we just want to check that a
program runs at all.  In that case, to ameliorate the slowness, we can
define more restricted versions of E-App-1 and E-App-2, in which the
subexpression that is not taking a step must be a _value_.  Finally,
we add an E-GetValBlock rule, which allows a _blocked_ `get`
expression to step to itself. This is necessary because a blocked
`get` is not a value.  We call the resulting reduction relation
`fast-rr`.

Under the `fast-rr` rules, an application expression in
which one subexpression is a blocked `get` will always be able to take
a step under one of the three application rules, but not all thread
interleavings will be explored.  The speed boost we get from that
comes at the price of modeling only a less realistic class of
implementations in which parallel evaluation is ``lockstep''.

### Building and running

Running `make all` in this directory will build all the lambdaLVar
languages and run all their test suites, using both reduction
relations.  Be warned: in the test suite for the lambdaLVar-nats
language, there's one particular that runs so slowly under `slow-rr`
that we put it in a "slow test suite" by itself. (To avoid the slow
test, simply run `make`.)

```
Running metafunction tests...All 57 tests passed.
cpu time: 14 real time: 13 gc time: 0
Running test suite with fast-rr...All 19 tests passed.
cpu time: 127 real time: 128 gc time: 16
Running test suite with slow-rr...All 19 tests passed.
cpu time: 486 real time: 486 gc time: 8
Running slow test suite with fast-rr...One test passed.
cpu time: 153 real time: 154 gc time: 4
Running slow test suite with slow-rr...One test passed.
cpu time: 365914 real time: 365523 gc time: 7949
```

The slow test takes several orders of magnitude longer when run with
`slow-rr` than with `fast-rr`.  Stepping through the test manually
using `traces` finds 64 terms for the slow version, and 15 for the
fast version.
